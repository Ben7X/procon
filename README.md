# Why does this crate exists?
At work, I was looking for a tool to convert a java property file into a yaml formatted property file.
- since I didn't find any good cli tool for the job I wrote my own tool
- I was also interested in this new cool hip programming language called **rust**.

That's being said I am a noob when it comes to rust development. So please be nice 😁
